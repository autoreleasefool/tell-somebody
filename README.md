# tell somebody
A platform that school's can introduce to reduce online harassment and improve their student community.

## What is it?

tell somebody is a mobile app written in React Native (to run on Android and iOS) that provides a safe space for students to report harassment in all of its forms, whether they've witnessed or been a victim of it. Additionally, the app provides a place for students to commend their peers. These commendations are posted publicly and other students can see the achievements of their fellow students.

From an admin (or educator's) perspective, they can see the reports provided by students, which remain private and are only accessible by admin. They also see the commendations students provide of their peers, before they are posted publicly. This allows admin to approve a message before it is publicly posted.

Finally, a public board provides a way for students to learn of and recognize the accomplishments and support among their peers. On the boards, students can star a commendation to recognize the accomplishments and good deeds of their peers.
